## Overview

The manticore is a legendary creature from Persian mythology, described as having a **human head**, a **lion's body**, and a **scorpion's tail** armed with venomous spines that can be shot like projectiles.

Its name derives from the Persian **'martyaxwar'** meaning "man-eater." First described by the Greek physician **Ctesias** in the 5th century BCE based on Persian accounts, the manticore is characterized by **three rows of teeth** running along each jaw, a trumpet-like voice, and the ability to devour its prey entirely—bones, clothing, and all—leaving no trace.

The creature was incorporated into medieval European bestiaries and heraldry. The manticore is **likely based on exaggerated accounts of Persian tigers**, possibly combined with cultural fears and mistranslation.

## Original Description

### Ctesias of Cnidus (5th century BCE)

According to **Ctesias**, the Greek physician to Persian King Artaxerxes II:

> *"The manticore (martyaxwar) is found in India. It has the face of a human, three rows of teeth, the body of a lion, and a tail like a scorpion's with stinging spines that can be shot like arrows. Its voice resembles a trumpet. It is red in color and devours its prey entirely, leaving nothing behind—not bones, clothing, or possessions."*

**Other Ancient Accounts:**
- **Aristotle** (4th century BCE) — Mentioned skeptically in *History of Animals*
- **Pliny the Elder** (1st century CE) — Included in Roman *Natural History*

---

## Behavior

### Diet: Exclusively Human

The manticore is described as preying **exclusively on humans**. It:
- Actively hunts people
- Devours victims completely
- Leaves **no remains** — no bones, clothing, or possessions
- Was feared throughout the regions it supposedly inhabited

---

## Likely Historical Basis

### The Tiger Theory

**Most scholars believe the manticore was based on Persian/Caspian tigers:**

**Evidence supporting tiger origin:**
1. **Tigers were present in Persia** — Historical range included Persia
2. **Man-eating tigers documented** — Behavior matches
3. **Three rows of teeth** — Likely exaggerated description of tiger teeth/fangs
4. **Red/orange coloration** — Matches tiger fur
5. **Size matches** — "Large as a lion"
6. **Man-eating behavior** — Tigers known to hunt humans

### Cultural Transmission Issues

**How a tiger became a manticore:**
1. **Secondhand accounts** — Ctesias relied on Persian stories he heard
2. **Translation errors** — Persian to Greek translation likely distorted details
3. **Cultural embellishment** — Fantastical elements added through oral transmission
4. **Exaggeration** — Fear and wonder amplified descriptions
5. **Mistranslation** — "Martyaxwar" (man-eater) may have been misunderstood

## Geographic Distribution

### Original Habitat

**Persian accounts:** Persia and surrounding regions
**Greek accounts:** India (likely confusion or expansion of range)

### Medieval Europe

The manticore was adopted into **medieval European bestiaries** as a literary creature, not claimed to exist locally.

---

## Symbolism

### Medieval Christian Interpretation

- **Symbol of the devil** devouring sinners
- **Complete consumption** as metaphor for damnation
- **Foreign/unknown dangers**
- **Exotic evil**

### Primary Meanings

1. **Savage predation** — Ultimate predator
2. **Exotic danger** — Threat from foreign lands
3. **The other/foreign threat** — Fear of the unknown
4. **Composite evil** — Multiple dangers combined
5. **Complete destruction** — Total annihilation
