      "full": "The manticore is a legendary creature from Persian mythology, described as having a human head, a lion's body, and a scorpion's tail armed with venomous spines that can be shot like projectiles. Its name derives from the Persian 'martyaxwar' meaning 'man-eater.' First described by the Greek physician Ctesias in the 5th century BCE based on Persian accounts, the manticore is characterized by three rows of teeth running along each jaw, a trumpet-like voice, and the ability to devour its prey entirely, bones and all, leaving no trace. The creature was incorporated into medieval European bestiaries and heraldry. The manticore is likely based on exaggerated accounts of Persian tigers, possibly combined with cultural fears and mistranslation."
