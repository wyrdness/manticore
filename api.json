      "full": "The manticore is a legendary creature from Persian mythology, described as having a **human head**, a **lion's body**, and a **scorpion's tail** armed with venomous spines that can be shot like projectiles. Its name derives from the Persian **'martyaxwar'** meaning \\\"man-eater.\\\" First described by the Greek physician **Ctesias** in the 5th century BCE based on Persian accounts, the manticore is characterized by **three rows of teeth** running along each jaw, a trumpet-like voice, and the ability to devour its prey entirely—bones, clothing, and all—leaving no trace. The creature was incorporated into medieval European bestiaries and heraldry. The manticore is **likely based on exaggerated accounts of Persian tigers**, possibly combined with cultural fears and mistranslation."
